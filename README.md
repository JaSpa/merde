# merde_json

Do you want to deal with JSON data? Are you not _that_ worried about the
performance overhead? (ie. you're writing a backend in Rust, but if it was
written in Node.js nobody would bat an eye).

Are you tired of waiting for proc macros to compile, and dealing with super
generic traits?

Do you not care about any formats other than JSON?

Are you ready to give up the comforts of `#[serde(rename_all)]`, `#[serde(flatten)]`, etc.?

Then the bag of compromises known as `merde_json` might just work for you!
